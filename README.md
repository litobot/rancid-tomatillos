## Overview of Project & Goals:

1. This application provides users with a simple way to view popular movies at a glance with their current collective rating by all users visiting the app.

2. Users can upvote or downvote movies as they see fit and the modified vote counts persist upon a page refresh.

3. Users can click a desired movie to view more details about it including an additional image, listed genres, and a brief overview of the movie's plot.

4. This application was built using React, React Router, and was end-to-end tested via Cypress utilizing API call interception and stubbed data to prevent unnecessary calls. We chose to deploy using Vercel as it was smooth and seamless.

5. Challenges: 

- We had some mismatches in scheduling due to being in different time zones and personal/family responsibilities. However, we synced for work over 90% of the time and made decent progress.

- Steep learning curve with React, React Router, and Cypress. That was a lot all at once.

6. Wins:

- Implementing Cypress and React Router effectively.

- Getting to work together and get to know each other better! <3

- Got some fun styling practice. It's nice to build something worth looking at.

- Getting more experience deploying.

7. Reflections:

- It seems like the rumors surrounding learning React regarding the steep learning curve are accurate.  There's a lot of stuff to get used to upfront, but it's clear once those are conquered, it's relatively straightforward.
